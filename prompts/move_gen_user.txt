Below is an example battle state and the resulting rational thought. Use the example to help with your action selection.
Example 1:
'''
Turn 11 (Last turn):
Espeon was switched in at 100% HP. Pyroar used Hyper Voice against Espeon, 
dealing damage and leaving it with 55% HP. There were no weather effects 
impacting the battle.

Turn 12 (Current turn):

Opponent has 5 Pokemon left.

Opponent's active Pokemon: pyroar (51% HP), Status: None, Ability: unnerve, 
Type 1: FIRE Type 2: NORMAL

pyroar is very weak (4x) to these attack types , weak (2x) to these attack 
types WATER, FIGHTING, GROUND, ROCK, resistant (0.5x) to these attack types 
FIRE, GRASS, ICE, BUG, STEEL, FAIRY, very resistant (0.25x) to these attack 
types NONE, and immune (0x) to these attack types GHOST.

pyroar has stronger FIRE type attacks as a result of it's same type attack 
bonus (1.5x). This attack type is supereffective (2x) against GRASS, ICE, 
BUG, STEEL, resisted (0.5x) by FIRE, WATER, ROCK, DRAGON, and immune (0x) to NONE.

pyroar also has stronger NORMAL moves. This attack type is supereffective 
(2x) against NONE, resisted (0.5x) by ROCK, STEEL, and immune (0x) to GHOST. 
Keep in mind that while this is the main attack type of the opposing 
Pokemon, it can use other typed moves as well.

Opponent's known available swtiches: abomasnow (100% HP)

Your active Pokemon: espeon (56% HP), Status: None, Ability: magicbounce, 
Type 1: PSYCHIC Type 2: None

Your active Pokemon has the following moves:

Move: alluringvoice, Base Power: 80, Type: FAIRY, Category: SPECIAL

Move: shadowball, Base Power: 80, Type: GHOST, Category: SPECIAL

Move: psychic, Base Power: 90, Type: PSYCHIC, Category: SPECIAL

Move: trick, Base Power: 0, Type: PSYCHIC, Category: STATUS

Your available Pokemon:

Available Switch: pawmot (28% HP), Status: None, Ability: ironfist, Type 1: 
ELECTRIC Type 2: FIGHTING

Available Switch: flareon (59% HP), Status: TOX (status) object, Ability: 
guts, Type 1: FIRE Type 2: None

Available Switch: ogerpon (49% HP), Status: None, Ability: defiant, Type 1: 
GRASS Type 2: None

Response to Example1:
'''
Let me think through this situation step by step:

1. Matchup Analysis:
- Pyroar (Fire/Normal) is currently at 51% HP
- My Espeon (Psychic) is at 56% HP and took significant damage from Hyper Voice
- Espeon's moves are not super-effective against Pyroar
- Ghost moves are actually immune against Normal-type

2. Threat Assessment:
- Pyroar has STAB Normal and Fire moves
- Neither are super-effective against Espeon
- But Hyper Voice has already shown to do significant damage (45%)

3. Available Options:
- Can stay in and use Psychic for neutral damage
- Shadow Ball would be blocked by Normal-typing
- Alluring Voice would be resisted
- Could switch to Pawmot for Fighting coverage, but it's low HP
- Ogerpon would be weak to Fire moves

4. Strategic Priority:
Given that Espeon is still above 50% HP and can deal neutral damage while not being weak to Pyroar's STAB moves, the best play is to stay in and use our strongest neutral move.

{{"Thought": "Espeon is in a neutral matchup against Pyroar. While none of our moves are super-effective, Psychic offers the highest base power (90) for neutral damage. With Espeon still healthy at 56% and no immediate threats, staying in to deal damage is better than risking a switch that could give Pyroar a free turn.", "action_type": "move", "action_name": "psychic"}}

Below is the current battle state. Analyze it and provide strategic reasoning for your recommended action.
Remember, to consider that switching is important to create favorable matchups, but switching too much can create a scenario where you are consistently taking damage without dealing any in return.
